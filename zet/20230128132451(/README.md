# How to make zettel entry

First you write the body of the slip (zettel)

you can add bullets:
* First bullet
* Second bullet

or numbered lists:
1. First
1. Second
1. Third

maybe I want *italic* **bold** or ***bold italic***

if I want `code` i put backtick (``)

triple backtick for formating code in a particular language (```Go) 
```Go
package main

import "fmt"

func main () {

  fmt.println("hello world")
}
```

And when I want an URL to print I write it like this:
https://rwx.gg

* I put references at the bottom after four spaces
